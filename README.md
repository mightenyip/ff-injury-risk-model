# NFL RB/WR Injury Risk Modeling

This project implements injury risk modeling for NFL running backs and wide receivers using logistic regression with spline terms. The model analyzes various player metrics and game statistics to predict injury probability.

## Features

- Logistic regression with spline terms for non-linear relationships
- Analysis of RB/WR injury patterns
- Feature engineering for player and game statistics
- Model evaluation and validation

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python injury_model.py
```

Or open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook injury_model.ipynb
```
